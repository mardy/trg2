You are still a kleptomanic rabbit head with wings. And in great danger of
becoming extinct. After stealing the precious gold coins from a dinosaur (it's
a T-Rex!), you fly over small hills and have the sudden urge to get shot and
lose your coins while avoiding death by stone or arrow.

Not to be confused with That Rabbit Game 1.


About
-----

This is the pure C++/OpenGL port of That Rabbit Game, also known as "Stone
Age Rabbit Hunt". The original version of this game has been developed in
the summer term 2010 at TU Vienna[1], where it has been called Mire Rabbit.
Since then, there has been a port of the game to C++/Qt (QGraphicsView),
which made the game a standalone release for multiple platforms[2]. Or to
quote the website: "Ports of That Rabbit Game exist for Maemo 5 (N900),
MeeGo 1.2 (N950, N9), Symbian^3 (N8-00, E7-00) and Symbian Anna/Belle
(808 PureView), HP/palm webOS (Palm Pre 2), MeeGo Tablet UX (ExoPC), iOS 5
(iPod Touch 4G) and for QNX (Blackberry Playbook OS, BB 10)".

Given the fact that this code has been ported from at least three different
languages / toolkit combinations (Java, C++ with Qt, pure C++), the code
has a strange layout (e.g. GameThread isn't really a thread, getters and
setters everywhere where public members would have been okay, etc..). Some
parts of the code (notably for-loops that used iterators before) have been
updated to C++11, I'm sure there's more that can be done in this area.

Some features that were part of the original Qt version (such as sounds)
have been removed from this open source release, as the playback code has
not been implemented; all the sound hooks are still in there, so it's just
a matter of adding sounds and playing them at the right time.

Incomplete features for which some parts are already prepared: Different
levels with increasing difficulty (number of rocks that are thrown), more
dangerous flying things such as arrows (graphics exist, but no code) that
can it the rabbit head from the side, saving and loading of scores, etc..

This open source release includes the Android port of That Rabbit Game 2!
The Android port shows how to do a simple OpenGL ES game with touch and
accelerometer input, and has been used before as an example for apkenv[3],
a compatibility layer for running native Android apps without Dalvik.
